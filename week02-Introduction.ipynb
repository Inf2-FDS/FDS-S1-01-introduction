If you are interested in creating your own notebooks, or you just generally want to get a better understanding, we recommend the following [tutorial](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2015/tutorials/t0b_intro_to_jupyter_notebooks.html). \n",

    "1. Code in one cell can run, even if there are errors in other cells.\n",

    "All objects created by running cells are stored in the *kernel* running in the background. You can restart the kernel by using the Kernel menu at the top of the notebook. Because of the issues with the state of the system noted in the remarks, we recommend that when developing notebooks, you periodically select **Kernel->Restart & Run All** to check that your code really is reproducible. If you run into problems, it can also be a good idea to select **Kernel->Restart & Run All**; the problem might be due to the state of the variables."
